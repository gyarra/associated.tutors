<h2>About Us</h2>
			
<p>We are a group of experienced and reliable tutors who work in various parts of New York and the surrounding region.  We tutor in almost all subjects, most tests, and all age groups from kindergarten to adults.  Because we work independently, we are able to charge lower rates than most commercial agencies. Thumbnail biographies of some of our members are given below.</p><br>

<p>If you are interested in our services for yourself or your child, or if you would like more information, please call:</p><br>
